# PACL
We proposed a novel pathway-based deep clustering method (PACL) for molecular subtyping of cancer by incorporating gene expression and biological pathway database.
PACL can capture nonlinear associations between high-dimensional gene expression data and patients’ survivals
PACL main contribution is to capture nonlinear associations between high-dimensional gene expression data and patients’ survivals and to interpret the model biologically.
