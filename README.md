# PACL
We proposed a novel pathway-based deep clustering method (PACL) for molecular subtyping of cancer by incorporating gene expression and biological pathway database.<br/>
PACL main contribution is to capture nonlinear associations between high-dimensional gene expression data and patientsâ€™ survivals and to interpret the model biologically.

To evaluate performance of PACL, we conducted experiments with highdimensional gene expression data of patients in Glioblastoma
Multiforme (GBM) and ovarian cancer./
Downloaded the datasets of [data_expression.txt](https://github.com/cBioPortal/datahub/blob/master/public/gbm_tcga) and [data_bcr_clinical_data_patient.txt](https://github.com/cBioPortal/datahub/blob/master/public/gbm_tcga) of GBM cancer.
Then gene expression data is preprocessed such that all the samples in gene expression data has respective survival months and status from 
clinical data.
